## 📖 Project Overview

passtw is a secure, minimalistic, and configurable command-line tool for generating and storing passwords locally in an encrypted vault. Designed for developers and sysadmins, it runs seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Generate secure random passwords;
* Encrypted local vault storage (AES-128);
* Configuration of password policies (character classes);
* Key generation and rotation;
* CLI-based usage with multiple commands;
* Cross-platform support (Linux / macOS / Windows);
* Clean project structure (`src/`, `tests/`);
* Automated tests for reliability.

---

## 📦 Requirements & Dependencies

* Python 3.10+;
* pip and pipx;
* Optional: virtual environment for isolation.

---

## 📥 Installation

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luqastw/passtw.git
cd passtw
sh install.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/luqastw/passtw.git
cd passtw
./install.ps1
```

---

## 🕹 Usage / CLI Commands

### Generate a new password:

```bash
passtw generate
```

### Set password policy options:

```bash
passtw set {option}
```

### Unset password policy options:

```bash
passtw unset {option}
```

### Show actual configuration:

```bash
passtw config
```

Use `passtw --help` for all available commands and options.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

* Configuration is stored locally in JSON format.
* You can adjust password inclusion of symbols, numbers, and other parameters.
* `set` and `unset` commands allow dynamic updates without editing the config manually.

---

## 🔐 Security & Vault

* Passwords are stored in an encrypted local vault using AES-128.
* Keys are generated and managed internally by the `keygen` module.
* No external storage or cloud dependencies — full local control.
* Recommended file permissions: restrict access to vault files to the current user only.
